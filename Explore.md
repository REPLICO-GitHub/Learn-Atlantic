# EXPLORE ATLANTIC

WELL, TO LEARN ATLANTIC FIRST YOU'LL HAVE TO 
SEE WHAT MADES ATLANTIC!

FIRST WE'LL LEARN, AT-ROOT

## AT-ROOT

AT-ROOT IS ATLANTIC'S MAIN PART, WHERE YOU INSERT THE MAIN CODE.
ATLANTIC IS MADE UP BY HTML, CSS, JS!
THE FILE NAME WOULD BE, `at-root.html`

AFTER THAT COMES, AT-IMG

## AT-IMG

AT-IMG IS WHERE YOU PUT THE IMAGE FILES THAT ISN'T A FILE
BUT A FOLDER CALLED `AT-IMG` YOU'LL HAVE TO 
PUT A IMAGE IN IT YOU CAN ALSO DELETE IT IF YOU DONT
WANT IT.

## AT-HELP

AT-HELP IS A FILE THAT HELPS YOU LEARN ATLANTIC, MORE EASILY
LIKE THIS ONE.

## END

ENDED, NOW WE'VE ENDED THE `EXPLORE` WE'VE MAKE MORE
SOON.
